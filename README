Plan to implement Canvas-Syncer in rust to gain higher reability and extension.

Current Version: 0.4.0-rc1


Roadmap:
1. use blocking to complete basic functions (finished)
2. switch to async (finished)
3. support features(i.e. file filter,detail downloading config)
4. allow uploading

https://github.com/BoYanZh/Canvas-Syncer

An async rust program that synchronizes files and folders across Canvas LMS Files and local. 

Check config.json.example. 

The default config file is `./config.json` and you can use `--config` to set its path.


You can use use cargo to install this program.

If you are using Windows or Linux, you can also use the compiled file in github releases. MacOS version is not provided in the release because of API issues of the script used in github actions.
