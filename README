Plan to implement Canvas-Syncer in rust to gain higher reability and extension.

Current Version: 0.1.0

Now support: download files and folders from canvas to local.
Not supported: update files.

Roadmap:
1. use blocking to complete basic functions
2. switch to async
3. support features(i.e. file filter,detail downloading config)
4. allow uploading

An async rust program that synchronizes files and folders across Canvas LMS Files and local. 

Check config.json.example. 

The default config file is `./config.json` and you can use `--config` to set its path.
