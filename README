Plan to implement Canvas-Syncer (https://github.com/BoYanZh/Canvas-Syncer) in rust to gain higher readability and extension.

Roadmap:
1. use blocking to complete basic functions (finished)
2. switch to async (finished)
3. support features(i.e. file filter, detail downloading config) (partly)
4. allow uploading

An async rust program that synchronizes files and folders across Canvas LMS Files and local. 

Check `config.json.example`. 

The default config file is `./config.json` and you can use `--config` to set its path.

You can use use cargo to install this program.

You can also directly use the compiled file in github releases in https://github.com/wznmickey/canvas_syncer/releases .
