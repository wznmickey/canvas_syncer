Plan to implement Canvas-Syncer in rust to gain higher reability and extension.

Current Version: 0.2.0


Roadmap:
1. use blocking to complete basic functions (finished)
2. switch to async (partly finished)
3. support features(i.e. file filter,detail downloading config)
4. allow uploading

An async rust program that synchronizes files and folders across Canvas LMS Files and local. 

Check config.json.example. 

The default config file is `./config.json` and you can use `--config` to set its path.
