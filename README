Plan to implement Canvas-Syncer in rust to gain higher reability and extension.



Roadmap:
1. use blocking to complete basic functions
2. switch to async
3. support features(i.e. file filter,detail downloading config)
4. allow uploading

Now you need to provide a key in my_key() function.
An async rust program that synchronizes files and folders across Canvas LMS Files and local.
